AloLang Compiler Readme

To compile, we suggest that you have the project made in a dedicated directory.
Use the following commands.

mkdir -p build
cd build
../configure
make

Now that you should see a file called aloc within the build directory.

To install that to your system, run the following command

make install

It will copy the associated file to your system's program directory(possibly be
/usr/local/bin).
